## tvp-repl

This repository configures [t]mux in junction with [v]im and [p]ython for a 
comfy REPL experience. Fixed plugins on the one hand and convoluted blog posts 
on the other, I decided to upload my gist.  

The magic consists of four inputs:
1. xclip
2. vim with +clipboard
3. tmux bindings to dump the clipboard
4. Pipe 1 to 3 through bindings in the dot-files.
